        <description>
    <p>A top the highest tower, swords clash. The half-elf is poised with his rapier held steady and his free hand tucked behind his back. As his half-orc opponent swings, he sidesteps effortlessly before landing a stab in her shoulder. She drops her axe, clutches her wounds, and reluctantly concedes her defeat.</p>
    <p class="indent">There is a commotion in the streets. A fight has broken out between two opposing merchants. An officer draped in formal regalia pushes through the crowd as he draws his saber. With a booming voice, he demands an end to the disturbance. His authority alone is enough to end the fight.</p>
    <p class="indent">Cannons fire. Sparks and splinters fly. As the ships collide, the pirate captain swings aboard the enemy vessel to take his prize. He dispatches two of the privateers with his throwing daggers before drawing his cutlass. If they surrender, he just might offer some of them a place on his crew.</p>
    <p class="indent">Buccaneers are many things. Polite, but bold. Cunning, but charming. Daring, but civilized. Fascinating, but deadly.</p>
    <h4>Tactical Warriors</h4>
    <p>What distinguishes a buccaneer from a common fighter? Presentation. A buccaneer's wits are just as sharp as their blades, and they are as fierce as they are charming. Buccaneers are always looking to hone their swordplay techniques. As such, they fight defensively, allowing their opponent to reveal their hand before going in for the kill. They favor precise cuts and counters over sheer force.</p>
    <h4>Honor Bound</h4>
    <p>Buccaneers live by honor codes that determine how they bear themselves both on and off the battlefield. These codes are composed of various virtues and values, this does not mean that all buccaneers are benevolent. After all, loyalty is a virtue, even if it means loyalty to your pirate crew.</p>
    <h4>Captivating Personalities</h4>
    <p>Whether they're aiming to become a renowned general or a pirate king, a buccaneer is always ambitious. To this end, they will cultivate an air of sophistication and magnetism that allows them to flourish amongst high society.</p>
    <h4>CREATING A Buccaneer</h4>
    <p>Your relationship with swordplay is an important part of your identity as a buccaneer. How were you trained with a blade? Did you enlist in a military unit? Were you trained by a wandering duelist who saved your town?</p>
    <p class="indent">Next, you must define your goal. Buccaneers are ambitious, and always have their sights set on their long-term objectives. Do you seek fortune? Fame? Renown? Infamy?</p>
    <h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
    <p>You can make a buccaneer quickly by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in Dexterity, and your next highest into Charisma. Second, choose the soldier or pirate background.</p>

You can make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check instead of a Strength (Athletics) check when attempting to grapple or shove a creature. This represents moves that deftly throw the target off balance without overpowering them, such as knocking a creature prone by tripping them with your foot or grappling a creature by twisting their arm behind their back.</p>
            <p class="indent">Additionally, you can use a reaction when a creature misses you with a melee attack to attempt to grapple or shove the creature if they are within 5 feet of you.</p>

            <p>When you choose this code at 3rd level, you have been trained in the use of ballistic weapons. You gain proficiency with the renaissance firearms described in chapter 9 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. If you are not wearing medium or heavy armor and are not wielding a shield, you gain the following benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bayonet.</strong> You can treat renaissance firearms as finesse melee weapons that deal 1d6 piercing damage. When used as melee weapons, pistols have the light property, and muskets have the reach property.</li>
                <li><strong>One-Liner.</strong> If a creature fails the saving throw against your Banter, you gain advantage on the next ranged attack you make against them before the end of your next turn.</li>
                <li><strong>Quickdraw.</strong> Whenever you draw or stow a weapon, you can draw or stow a renaissance firearm as well.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent">You gain proficiency with Tinkerer's Tools if you didn't have it already. By investing time and money, you can use Tinkerer's Tools to craft firearms.</p>
